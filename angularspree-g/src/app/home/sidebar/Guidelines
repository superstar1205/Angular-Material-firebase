This part of the application is highly generic for eg.

* OptionTypes can change as per user requirement. eg. color, size, price etc.
* ShopBy taxonomies feature. eg. category & brand by default.
* Filters can also be added.

2. Categories options T-shirts, Kurtas, Jeans etc.
3. Brand options Roadster, ONLY, tommy hilfiger, Vero Moda etc.
4. Color Options with the whole range.
5. Price slider to filter range.
6. Promotions tab eg. Buy 1 get on free.
