<h5>Angular - Virtual Scrolling <hr /></h5>
<p><b>Infinite Scroll:</b> Initially loads only few items and keep appending more items to the list as you scroll, 
  it gives the complete snapshot of the list but as more and more items keep adding, list is going to slow down 
  eventually as the number of nodes in the DOM are increasing and thus application will start slowing down.</p>

<p><b>Virtual Scroll:</b> Display only small subset of the data that is in the viewport and keep changing the records 
  as the user scrolls. It keep the number of DOM elements constant hence boosting the performance of the application.</p>


<ul class="list">
  <cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport  style="height: 500px" itemSize="90" >
    <ng-container *cdkVirtualFor="let n of numbers">
      <li> {{n}} </li>
    </ng-container>
  </cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>
</ul>
