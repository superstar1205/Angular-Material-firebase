## TypeScript Notes


#### Q. What are the typescript features? How typescript is different from ES6?
**TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces.
Typescript is an extension of ES6. Some features that are additionally included in Typescript are:

* TypeScript supports new ECMAScript standards and compiles them to (older) ECMAScript targets of your choosing. This means that you can use features of ES2015 and beyond, like modules, lambda functions, classes, the spread operator, destructuring

* TypeScript includes interfaces, enums, hybrid types, generics, union and intersection types, access modifiers and much more. TypeScript makes typing a bit easier and a lot less explicit by the usage of type inference.

* With strict null checks enabled (`--strictNullChecks` compiler flag) the TypeScript compiler will not allow undefined to be assigned to a variable unless you explicitly declare it to be of nullable type.

* The TypeScript compiler can inline source map information in the generated `.js` files or create separate `.map` files. This makes it possible to set breakpoints and inspect variables during runtime directly on TypeScript code.
